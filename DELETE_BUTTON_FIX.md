# Delete Button Fix - CSP Issue Resolved

## 🚨 **Issue Fixed: Content Security Policy Violations**

The delete button wasn't working because of **Content Security Policy (CSP) violations**. Chrome extensions block inline event handlers like `onclick="..."` for security reasons.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

1. **Removed inline event handlers** - No more `onclick="trackHubPopup.deleteTracking()"`
2. **Added data attributes** - Used `data-item-id` to store item IDs
3. **Added event listeners** - Proper event delegation with `addEventListener`
4. **Added debugging** - Console logs to track the delete flow

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find TrackHub extension
3. Click the refresh/reload button
4. Check console for any remaining CSP errors

### Step 2: Test Delete Button
1. **Open TrackHub extension**
2. **Add a tracking item** (if you don't have any)
3. **Click the trash icon** on any tracking item
4. **Check console** for debug messages:
   ```
   Delete button clicked for item: [item-id]
   deleteTracking called with itemId: [item-id]
   Current tracking items: [...]
   Item to delete: {...}
   Showing delete confirmation dialog...
   ```

### Step 3: Test Confirmation Dialog
1. **Confirmation dialog should appear** with item details
2. **Click "Cancel"** - Should close dialog, item remains
3. **Click "Delete"** - Should remove item, show success message

## 🔍 **Debug Console Messages**

### Expected Success Flow:
```
✅ Delete button clicked for item: 1234567890
✅ deleteTracking called with itemId: 1234567890
✅ Current tracking items: [{id: "1234567890", ...}]
✅ Item to delete: {id: "1234567890", trackingNumber: "...", ...}
✅ Showing delete confirmation dialog...
✅ Delete confirmation result: true
✅ Tracking item deleted successfully
```

### If Something Goes Wrong:
```
❌ Delete button clicked for item: 1234567890
❌ deleteTracking called with itemId: 1234567890
❌ Current tracking items: []
❌ Tracking item not found for ID: 1234567890
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: No Console Messages
**Symptoms:** Clicking delete button shows no console output
**Solution:**
- Check if extension is properly reloaded
- Verify popup.js is updated
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Issue 2: "Tracking item not found"
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Tracking item not found for ID"
**Solution:**
- Check if tracking items are loaded
- Verify item IDs match
- Reload tracking items

### Issue 3: Dialog Doesn't Appear
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Showing delete confirmation dialog..." but no dialog
**Solution:**
- Check for CSS/z-index issues
- Verify dialog HTML is created
- Check for JavaScript errors

## 📋 **Test Checklist**

- [ ] Extension reloads without CSP errors
- [ ] Delete button click shows console message
- [ ] Item details are found correctly
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Cancel button works
- [ ] Delete button works
- [ ] Item is removed from list
- [ ] Success message appears

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

1. **Click trash icon** → Console shows "Delete button clicked"
2. **Dialog appears** → Shows item details with Cancel/Delete buttons
3. **Click Delete** → Item removed, success message shown
4. **Click Cancel** → Dialog closes, item remains

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Before (CSP Violation):
```html
<button onclick="trackHubPopup.deleteTracking('123')">Delete</button>
```

### After (CSP Compliant):
```html
<button class="delete-btn" data-item-id="123">Delete</button>
```

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const itemId = button.getAttribute('data-item-id');
    this.deleteTracking(itemId);
});
```

The delete functionality should now work properly without CSP violations! 🎉
