## ✅ **Delete Feature Complete**

The delete functionality now includes:
1. ✅ **Confirmation dialog** - Asks for permission before deleting
2. ✅ **Local deletion** - Removes from Chrome storage
3. ✅ **Backend API ready** - Will sync when backend is available
4. ✅ **Error handling** - Works even if backend is not ready

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Add Some Tracking Items
1. Open TrackHub extension
2. Add a few tracking numbers manually
3. Or use context menu to add from web pages

### Step 2: Test Delete Functionality
1. **Click the trash icon** on any tracking item
2. **Confirmation dialog should appear** with:
   - Item details (tracking number, carrier, description)
   - "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons
   - Red delete button for emphasis

### Step 3: Test Confirmation Options
1. **Click "Cancel"** - Dialog should close, item should remain
2. **Click "Delete"** - Item should be removed from list
3. **Success message** should appear: "Tracking item deleted successfully"

### Step 4: Test Keyboard Shortcuts
1. **Press Escape** - Should cancel the delete operation
2. **Click outside dialog** - Should cancel the delete operation

## 🔍 **What Happens During Delete**

### Local Deletion (Always Works)

2. ✅ UI updated immediately
3. ✅ Success notification shown

### Backend Sync (When Available)
1. 🔄 API call sent to external backend
2. 🔄 Database updated on server
3. 🔄 Sync confirmation received

### Error Handling

2. ⚠️ No error messages shown to user
3. ⚠️ Console logs show backend status

## 🔧 **Backend Integration (Future)**

When the backend API is ready:

1. **Update the URL** in `popup.js`:
   ```javascript
   const backendUrl = 'https://your-actual-backend.com';
   ```

2. **API Endpoint Expected**:
   ```
   DELETE /api/tracking/delete
   Body: {
     trackingId: "item-id",
     trackingNumber: "tracking-number",
     brand: "carrier",
     description: "description"
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication**: Uses OAuth token from Google login

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

1. **Click trash icon** → Confirmation dialog appears
2. **Click "Delete"** → Item removed, success message shown
3. **Click "Cancel"** → Dialog closes, item remains
4. **Backend sync** → Happens silently in background

The delete functionality is now complete and ready to use! 🎉
