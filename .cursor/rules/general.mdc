this app is going to be chrom app, 

architecture would be 
- CHROM APP 
- BACKEND  ( THIS BACK END IS EXTERNAL in another project) 

MAIN COMMUNICATE WOULD BE JUST API . 
REGARDING LOGIN, 
It should had start with basic login , Custom API for google signup\sign in 

DO NOT IMPLEMENT CHROM IDENTIY API yet since the app not functioning correctly. 

Keep the cOde clean, 
No need for length documentations or .md file
Keep explanation pact and brief enough to manuever throughh the features . 
Alert if the feature is too much or mistake. 
Avoid spending too much token as necessary
